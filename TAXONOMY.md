# Taxonomy

What `wherefore` can currently detect, what's planned, and how to add
a new pattern. For the build history — bugs found, design decisions,
why things are built the way they are — see
[`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md), which is a deep-dive log,
not a reference doc.

## What's built

Seven patterns, each with a YAML definition, a real corruptor (so it
can be tested against labeled synthetic data), and a detection
signature. Six are column-mismatch patterns; one (`dedup_failure`) is
structurally different — see the note below the table.

| Pattern | What it detects | Signature approach |
|---|---|---|
| `timezone_shift` | A constant time offset across affected rows | All affected rows differ by the same delta |
| `truncation` | Values cut off at a fixed length | Target is a literal prefix of source |
| `enum_drift` | A lookup/enum value renamed or recoded | Same source value consistently maps to the same target value |
| `null_type_coercion` | A genuine null written as literal text (`"NULL"`, `"N/A"`) | One side is null, the other is a known sentinel string |
| `float_precision` | Precision lost through float32 rounding | Exact float32 round-trip check, not a magnitude estimate |
| `encoding_mismatch` | UTF-8 text misread as Latin-1 ("mojibake") | Exact reverse-transform check, not a regex |
| `dedup_failure` | A row duplicated with a new auto-generated key | Unmatched row's content exactly matches an existing row |

`dedup_failure` is the odd one out: its signal never appears as a
column-level mismatch — it shows up as an extra row entirely. It's
detected through a separate code path
(`detect_row_presence_patterns`), not the column-based dispatch the
other six use. It's fully built and tested, but not yet wired into
the automated eval harness (which currently only scores column
patterns) — a known, tracked gap, not a hidden one.

**Eval results** (reproducible, no API key needed):
```bash
python3 -m evals.harness.run_eval
```
100% accuracy across all 7 column-pattern fixtures. Small sample —
proves the mechanism works, not that it's bulletproof at scale. See
the main [README](./README.md#evals--why-trust-the-explanations) for
the full results and the honest caveat.

## What's planned

- **`key_mismatch`** — a row that should have matched didn't, because
  its key was reformatted (`EMP-1001` vs `EMP1001`) and `--fuzzy-keys`
  either wasn't used or didn't resolve it. Like `dedup_failure`, this
  is a row-presence pattern, not a column pattern — it reuses the same
  clustering extension.
- **More fixture coverage** — every pattern above is proven on one
  labeled fixture. Real statistical confidence needs more.
- **Database connectivity** — Postgres, MySQL, SQLite. File-based
  sources (local + `s3://`) only, today.

## How a pattern works

Every pattern is **data, not code** — a YAML file under
`src/wherefore/taxonomy/patterns/`, validated against a strict schema
(`taxonomy/schema.py`). A pattern has:

- `id`, `display_name`, `description` — what it is, in plain English
- `detection_hints` — which dtype(s) it applies to, and which
  signature function (in `clustering/signatures.py`) checks for it
- `llm_context` — guidance for the AI reasoning layer when writing the
  narrative for a match
- `synthetic_corruption` — which corruptor function
  (`synthetic/corruptors/`) generates labeled test fixtures for this
  pattern

Clustering never makes causal claims — it only ever reports
statistical observations ("these 12 rows differ by exactly 5 hours").
Deciding *why* is the AI's job. This boundary is enforced by a
structural test, not just convention.

## Adding a new pattern

Full step-by-step contract: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
Short version: write the corruptor first and look at what it actually
produces before writing the signature or YAML. Every real bug caught
during this project's build (a false-positive signature, a dtype
mismatch nobody anticipated, a registry lookup silently failing) was
caught specifically because the corruptor existed first and produced
real data to test against — not because anyone guessed correctly in
advance. Also easy to miss: after writing a new signature function in
`clustering/signatures.py`, it still needs to be added to
`SIGNATURE_REGISTRY` — a separate step from defining the function itself.
