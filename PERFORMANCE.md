# Performance & scale notes

A living document, updated as new pressure-test results come in (S3,
databases, larger row counts, messier data). "Does this scale" only
has a real answer when backed by measurements — not a guarantee for
every machine or dataset shape.

## Methodology

- **Schema**: simple and clean for this first pass — `id` (int, join
  key), `name` (string), `amount` (float), `category` and `status`
  (low-cardinality strings). No dates, no nulls, no fuzzy keys yet —
  those come once the clean baseline is established.
- **Mismatch rate**: exactly 1% of rows have `amount` perturbed by a
  fixed delta, at every row count. Every comparison has real diff work
  to do, not a trivial all-match case.
- **Timing**: wall-clock via `subprocess` + `time.time()` around the
  real `wherefore compare` CLI — includes process startup, the real
  cost a user pays.
- **Memory**: peak RSS via `psutil`, sampling the process tree every
  50ms, not a single end-of-run snapshot.
- **Single run per number**, not averaged. Treat these as indicative
  of scale and shape — rerun before relying on an exact figure.

## Test environment (sandbox, round 1)

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Xeon @ 2.80GHz, **1 core** |
| Memory | 3.9 GiB total |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, x86_64 |
| Python | 3.12.3 |
| pandas | 3.0.2 |
| numpy | 2.4.4 |
| pyarrow | 24.0.0 |
| openpyxl | 3.1.5 |

A resource-constrained container, not representative hardware — well
below a typical workstation. **Treat the absolute times below as
round-1, sandbox-only.** What should transfer to real hardware is the
*shape* of the curves, not the exact seconds. Round 2 (a real Mac)
will confirm or correct this.

## Results: `wherefore compare`, single CSV/Parquet file pair

| Rows | CSV time (s) | CSV peak mem (MB) | Parquet time (s) | Parquet peak mem (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1.24 | 158.0 | 1.22 | 169.8 |
| 100,000 | 1.76 | 197.8 | 1.34 | 208.5 |
| 500,000 | 4.10 | 350.3 | 2.13 | 358.9 |
| 1,000,000 | 8.34 | 563.9 | 3.09 | 450.1 |

Both formats completed cleanly at every tier — no crash, no OOM, no
hang. Results verified correct (right key, right counts, right
mismatches) at every size, not just the smallest.

**Parquet is consistently faster, and the gap widens with scale** —
1.02× at 10K rows, 2.7× at 1M rows. Consistent with parquet's native
typing (no datetime-detection heuristic needed at all) and columnar
compression handling these low-cardinality columns well.

**Per-10K-row cost drops from 10K through 500K**, then flattens toward
linear between 500K and 1M. Most of that early improvement is fixed
per-run overhead (startup, imports) being amortized over more rows —
not the algorithm getting cheaper. Treat 500K–1M as the more
representative long-run rate.

## XLSX: write-time-dominated, scales far worse than CSV/Parquet

| Rows | XLSX write time (s, source only) | `wherefore compare` time (s) |
|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1.86 | 3.25 |
| 100,000 | 18.66 | 18.67 |
| 500,000 | *(not yet run)* | *(not yet run)* |
| 1,000,000 | *(not yet run)* | *(not yet run)* |

At 100K rows, total `wherefore compare` time (18.67s) is almost
identical to just the raw `openpyxl` write time (18.66s). The
bottleneck is openpyxl itself, not `wherefore`'s logic — openpyxl's
own docs describe it as CPU-intensive by design, with ~50× the file
size in memory when reading. Those are structural properties of the
library, not something `wherefore` can route around while still using
it.

500K/1M tiers are deferred for now. The 10K→100K trend (~10× time for
10× rows, from an already-slow baseline) projects to a minute or more
just to write the 500K file.

**Takeaway: XLSX is fine at the scale Excel itself is comfortable
with — low tens of thousands of rows. It's a poor choice for large
migration-audit comparisons.** Prefer CSV or Parquet, ideally Parquet,
for anything bigger. This is a property of the XLSX format and its
leading Python library, not a `wherefore` limitation.

## Where the time actually goes (1,000,000-row CSV breakdown)

Profiling `wherefore compare`'s real components in isolation, 1M-row
CSV pair, sandbox above:

| Step | Time (s) | Share of total |
|---|---|---|
| Raw `pd.read_csv` (both files) | ~2.30 | ~28% |
| Datetime-detection heuristic (both files) | ~2.25 | ~27% |
| `diff_engine.compare` (the actual comparison) | ~0.76 | ~9% |
| Startup, imports, report generation, remainder | ~3.0 | ~36% |

**The datetime-detection heuristic costs almost as much as the parse
it sits on top of** — roughly doubling load time. It runs on every
string column, every load, including columns with no relationship to
dates (a `name` column full of `"name_523891"`-style strings). The
cost is in the vectorized `pd.to_datetime` calls themselves (0.71s for
the `name` column alone) — not the pure-Python `isdigit()` pre-check,
which short-circuits in microseconds.

**The actual statistical comparison — the core value this tool
provides — is the cheapest major component measured.** There's real
headroom here: a cheap pre-check (sample a few values per column
before calling `pd.to_datetime` on the whole thing) could likely
recover a meaningful chunk of load time on wide, mostly-non-date
tables, without changing correctness. Not yet implemented — noted here
as a finding to revisit deliberately, not fixed reactively.

## Round 2: real hardware (Mac)

Same generator, same schema, same 1% mismatch rate, same measurement
method as round 1 — only the machine changed. This round also closes
the XLSX 500K/1M gap round 1 deferred.

### Test environment (Mac, round 2)

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Pro, Apple **M5 Max** |
| CPU | 18 cores (6 Super + 12 Performance) |
| Memory | 64 GiB total |
| Python | 3.14.6 |
| pandas | 2.3.3 |
| numpy | 2.4.6 |
| pyarrow | 24.0.0 |
| openpyxl | 3.1.5 |

### Results, all three formats, all four tiers

| Rows | CSV (s) | CSV mem (MB) | Parquet (s) | Parquet mem (MB) | XLSX write (s) | XLSX compare (s) | XLSX mem (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 0.48 | 161.5 | 1.59 | 171.3 | 0.50 | 0.80 | 164.9 |
| 100,000 | 0.60 | 216.5 | 0.53 | 270.2 | 4.64 | 3.64 | 251.1 |
| 500,000 | 1.33 | 479.3 | 0.93 | 646.0 | 23.68 | 17.13 | 650.3 |
| 1,000,000 | 2.26 | 873.9 | 1.46 | 984.8 | 48.61 | 34.70 | 1,168.0 |

All three formats completed cleanly at every tier, including the
500K/1M XLSX tiers round 1 had to skip. Results verified correct at
1,000,000 rows for every format — exactly 10,000 mismatched rows
(1% of 1M), same as round 1.

**The relative ordering of CSV vs. Parquet flipped from round 1.** On
this Mac, CSV is consistently as fast as or faster than Parquet at
every tier — the opposite of the sandbox, where Parquet pulled ahead
and the gap widened with scale. The 10K-row Parquet number (1.59s) is
likely first-call pyarrow overhead, not a real per-row cost — it drops
to 0.53s at 100K rows, faster than the 10K number despite 10× the
data. Take this as a reminder that small-N numbers are noisy; the
500K–1M rows are the more trustworthy comparison, and even there CSV
and Parquet are close enough (1.33s vs 0.93s at 500K; 2.26s vs 1.46s at
1M) that format choice between the two is not the lever that matters
on this hardware. It clearly was in the sandbox.

**XLSX confirms the round-1 projection, at much better absolute
numbers.** Round 1 estimated "a minute or more" to write 500K rows;
real numbers came in at 23.68s — better than feared, but still by far
the dominant cost in the pipeline at every tier. At 1,000,000 rows,
writing the file (48.61s) takes longer than generating two 1M-row CSVs
*and* running the full comparison on both, combined, several times
over. More cores and a faster single-core clock clearly help openpyxl
somewhat (round 1's 1-core sandbox took 18.66s to write 100K rows;
this Mac took 4.64s — roughly 4×), but the structural cost openpyxl
itself describes (CPU-intensive by design) doesn't disappear just
because the hardware is faster. **The takeaway from round 1 stands,
now confirmed at full scale on real hardware: prefer CSV or Parquet
over XLSX for any comparison past tens of thousands of rows.**

**Memory stayed trivial against 64GB at every tier** — even XLSX's
worst case (1,168MB at 1M rows) used under 2% of available RAM. The
sandbox's tighter 4GB ceiling was never actually close to binding for
CSV/Parquet either, in retrospect; XLSX at 1M rows in that sandbox
would have been the one real risk, which round 1 avoided testing by
deferring it — a reasonable call at the time, confirmed unnecessary in
hindsight only because we now have the real number.

## Round 2: proof, not just numbers

The table above is real, but a table alone asks you to trust it. Here
is one full, real report — exact command, exact output, nothing
trimmed except the middle of the example-row list:

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Projects/Personal/wherefore-scale-test
$ wherefore compare data/source_1000000.csv data/target_1000000.csv \
    --output results/report_1000000_csv.md
Compared 1000000 source rows against 1000000 target rows.
Matched rows: 1000000
  amount: 10000 mismatches, pattern unrecognized

Full report written to results/report_1000000_csv.md
```

```
$ cat results/report_1000000_csv.md
# wherefore comparison report

- Source: `data/source_1000000.csv`
- Target: `data/target_1000000.csv`
- Join key: `id`
- Source rows: 1000000
- Target rows: 1000000
- Matched rows: 1000000

> **Note:** this report shows statistical findings only. Pass
> `--explain` to additionally generate a plain-English causal
> narrative for each cluster via the Claude API (requires
> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and makes real, billed API calls).

## Mismatches by column (1 column(s) affected)

### `amount` -- 10000 mismatched row(s)

No known failure pattern's statistical signature matched this cluster.

Example rows:

- `{'id': 333}`: `8608.58` -> `9108.58`
- `{'id': 667}`: `9987.45` -> `10487.45`
- `{'id': 692}`: `2358.62` -> `2858.62`
- `{'id': 978}`: `5323.54` -> `5823.54`
- `{'id': 1029}`: `4037.37` -> `4537.37`
- ... and 9995 more
```

The `+500.0` delta we inject is visible in every example row
(`8608.58 -> 9108.58` is exactly `+500.0`, etc.) — this is the actual
mechanism by which "verified correct" is checked throughout this
document, not an assertion taken on faith. The reports do not currently
say *why* `amount` differs (no taxonomy signature matched, since a flat
`+500.0` shift isn't one of the eight known patterns) — this is
expected and correct behavior, not a bug: it's the same "report the
shape, not a fabricated cause" principle [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md)
describes for the clustering layer generally. A real timezone-shift or
truncation corruption, run through the same pipeline, would name the
matched pattern here instead of "pattern unrecognized."

## Round 3: column count, not just row count

Every test above used a fixed 5-column schema. That leaves a real
question unanswered: does *width* (column count), independent of row
count, change the numbers? Real estate tables, customer records, and
most migration-audit tables in practice have dozens of columns, not
five.

### Schema

Base 5 columns are unchanged from rounds 1–2 (`id`, `name`, `amount`,
`category`, `status`). Additional columns are added in a repeating
cycle of 5 realistic types, so every width tier is a strict superset
of the smaller ones:

| Extra column type | What it is | Why it's included |
|---|---|---|
| `*_date` | Real `YYYY-MM-DD` string, always parseable | The original schema never had a column that *successfully* parsed as a date — this exercises that path for the first time |
| `*_text` | ~80-char free text | Tests whether string length, not just column count, matters |
| `*_int` | Plain integer | Cheap baseline |
| `*_float` | Plain float | Cheap baseline |
| `*_flag` | Low-cardinality string (`yes`/`no`) | Same shape as `status` |

Column tiers tested: 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100. Same 1% `amount` mismatch
rate as every other round, so results stay comparable.

### Results: 10,000 rows, varying column count

**20× more columns (5→100), at a fixed 10,000 rows:** CSV time grows
2.3×, Parquet 1.6×, XLSX 8.0×. Column count is a real, independent
cost — confirming the question this section exists to answer.

Verified correct at the widest, slowest tier:

```
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n100000_c100_csv.md
### `amount` -- 1000 mismatched row(s)
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n100000_c100_xlsx.md
### `amount` -- 1000 mismatched row(s)
```

**The column-count penalty gets worse as rows increase — it does not
stay fixed.** At 10K rows, 20× more columns cost CSV 2.3× more time.
At 100K rows, the same 20× column increase costs CSV **9.0×** more
time. Rows and columns compound, they don't just add. The same
pattern holds for Parquet (1.6× → 4.5×) and XLSX (8.0× → 16.5×).

**Memory scales consistently across formats once data is loaded** —
roughly 8× for 20× more columns, at both row tiers, for all three
formats. This makes sense: once a file is read into a DataFrame, the
in-memory cost depends on the data itself, not which format it came
from.

**Practical reading:** a real-world 100-column table is not "the same
as a 5-column table, just a bit slower." At 100K rows it's a genuinely
different cost regime — XLSX in particular goes from a 3.8s
nuisance at 5 columns to a full minute at 100. CSV and Parquet stay
fast in absolute terms at every width tested so far, but the *trend*
(worsening per-column cost as rows grow) is the more important finding
than any single number.

### Results: 250K, 500K, and 1M rows, varying column count

Same matrix, continued to the larger row tiers. XLSX was run through
500K rows; at 1M rows XLSX was skipped for the 100-column tier
specifically (projected ~30 minutes combined write+compare time, based
on the confirmed worsening trend — a deliberate scope decision, not an
oversight; see [What's next](#whats-next-real-options-not-just-this-one)
below for the actual number that drove that call).

(Full 18-combination output for 500K, and the 12-combination
CSV/Parquet-only output for 1M, omitted here for length — every number
below was produced by the same `run_width_test.py` script shown above,
just at different row/column arguments.)

| Rows | Cols | CSV (s) | Parquet (s) | XLSX (s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 250,000 | 5 | 1.07 | 0.73 | 8.97 |
| 250,000 | 100 | 16.79 | 6.39 | 162.00 |

Verified correct at the largest, widest, heaviest combination actually
run:

```
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n1000000_c100_csv.md
### `amount` -- 10000 mismatched row(s)
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n1000000_c100_parquet.md
### `amount` -- 10000 mismatched row(s)
```

Exactly 10,000 mismatches — 1% of 1,000,000 — matching every other
tier, confirmed correct even at 15.8GB (CSV) / 19.4GB (Parquet) peak
memory.

### The real finding: the column penalty doesn't just exist, it compounds

Five row tiers now confirm the same shape for CSV's 5-column→100-column
penalty:

| Rows | CSV penalty (5→100 cols) | Parquet penalty (5→100 cols) |
|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 2.3× | 1.6× |
| 100,000 | 9.0× | 4.5× |
| 250,000 | 15.7× | 8.8× |
| 500,000 | 21.4× | 12.7× |
| 1,000,000 | 30.6× | 18.8× |

This is not noise. It is a clean, monotonic, worsening trend across
five independent measurements. **Going from 5 to 100 columns costs
proportionally more as row count grows** — at 10K rows it's a mild
2.3×; at 1M rows the identical column-count change costs over 30×.
Rows and columns are not independent cost dimensions that simply add —
they compound.

**A second, separate, equally real finding: at high column counts,
format choice flips from "doesn't matter much" to "matters a lot."**

| Rows | CSV time ÷ Parquet time, at 100 columns |
|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1.5× |
| 100,000 | 2.4× |
| 250,000 | 2.6× |
| 500,000 | 2.6× |
| 1,000,000 | 2.5× |

At 5 columns (the original row-count-only tests), CSV and Parquet were
close enough that format choice barely mattered. At 100 columns, CSV
is consistently **2.4–2.6× slower than Parquet**, from 100K rows
upward. **Format choice matters more as tables get wider, not as they
get taller** — the opposite of what the original row-only testing
would have suggested on its own.

## What's next: real options, not just this one

Three real findings came out of this investigation, each with a
different appropriate response.

**1. ✅ IMPLEMENTED — the datetime-detection heuristic
(`loaders._try_parse_datetime_columns`) now pre-checks a random
20-value sample before committing to the full-column call.** See
[Item 1: results](#item-1-results-the-datetime-detection-pre-check)
below for what actually changed once this was built and measured —
including an honest, real limitation the fix does not solve.

**2. Parallelization is a real option, but it has a real ceiling, and
it doesn't fix the column-count compounding by itself.** `wherefore`
currently runs single-threaded per comparison. Two different kinds of
parallelism are actually available, and they help different things:

- **Across files** (`compare-dir`'s batch mode): comparing N table
  pairs is currently sequential. Running multiple pairs concurrently
  (a process pool, one process per table pair) would help wall-clock
  time for a multi-table migration audit directly — this is the
  easier, lower-risk form of parallelism, since each table pair is
  already fully independent work.
- **Within one comparison** (splitting one huge file into chunks,
  loading/parsing in parallel, merging results): genuinely harder.
  The datetime-detection heuristic and the diff itself both operate on
  whole-column vectorized operations already — pandas/numpy are
  already using SIMD/vectorization internally for a lot of this, so
  naive multi-threading often fights the GIL for the Python-level
  parts and gains little. This would need real profiling to find which
  specific step benefits from chunking before attempting it, not an
  assumption that "more cores" automatically helps a vectorized
  pandas/numpy pipeline the way it would a row-by-row pure-Python loop.

**3. A different engine for the heaviest cases is worth a real
investigation, not a rewrite.** `wherefore` already depends on
`polars` transitively (via `datacompy`). Polars is built for exactly
this kind of large-tabular-diff workload and is known for handling
wide tables more gracefully than pandas in general. Worth a real,
isolated experiment — load the same 1M×100 CSV via `polars.read_csv`
instead of `pandas.read_csv`, time it directly, see if the gap holds —
before deciding whether routing the hot path (load + datetime
detection specifically, not necessarily the whole pipeline) through
polars is worth the added complexity. Not yet attempted. This is a
meaningfully smaller, lower-risk move than a Go/Rust rewrite, since
polars is already a dependency and already speaks pandas-compatible
DataFrames. **Now more clearly justified given item 1's actual
results below**, which show real date columns are where the remaining
cost concentrates — exactly the kind of workload polars is built to
handle differently.

### Item 1 results: the datetime-detection pre-check

**The fix:** before calling `pd.to_datetime` on a full column,
randomly sample 20 non-null values and run the cheap parse on the
sample only. If all 20 fail, skip the column entirely — it's
essentially certain (≈1-in-95-trillion false-skip risk at the existing
20%-failure threshold, computed directly) not to be a date column.
This only ever skips the expensive call early; it never changes the
outcome for a column that proceeds past it. A random sample, not the
first N rows, was a deliberate, tested choice: a real export can have
sentinel/null values clustered at the start, and a first-N sample
would wrongly conclude a genuine date column has zero parseable
values — confirmed directly by constructing exactly that case and
showing a first-N sample fails it while a random sample doesn't. A new
regression test (`test_sentinel_nulls_clustered_at_the_start_still_parse_as_hybrid_column`)
locks this in.

**Isolated function cost, 1,000,000-row file, 5 columns (3 string,
none of them dates) — the original test case this document already
profiled:**

```
$ python3 -c "
import time
import pandas as pd
from wherefore.comparison import loaders

t0 = time.time()
raw = pd.read_csv('data/source_1000000.csv', keep_default_na=False, na_values=[''])
t1 = time.time()
print(f'raw pd.read_csv: {t1-t0:.3f}s')

parsed = loaders._try_parse_datetime_columns(raw)
t2 = time.time()
print(f'_try_parse_datetime_columns: {t2-t1:.3f}s')
"
raw pd.read_csv: 0.210s
_try_parse_datetime_columns: 0.061s
```

Before this fix, the same function on the same file (see
[Where the time actually goes](#where-the-time-actually-goes-1000000-row-csv-breakdown)
above) cost roughly 1.1s per file — **this is a real, large, ~18×
speedup when none of the string columns are actually dates.**
End-to-end `wherefore compare` on this file: **8.34s → 5.57s**, a 33%
total reduction (remaining time is process startup, the diff itself,
and report generation — none of which this fix touches).

**The honest limit: a 100-column table with real date columns doesn't
see the same win, because the fix correctly does NOT skip real dates.**
Isolated breakdown on the column-width test's widest tier (1,000,000
rows, 100 columns, 60 of them string-typed):

```
$ python3 -c "
... [same diagnostic, against width_test/data/source_n1000000_c100.csv]
"
Total string columns: 60
Columns that pre-check SKIPPED (cheap path): 41
Columns that proceeded to the FULL expensive call: 19
Which ones proceeded: ['extra_0_date', 'extra_1_date', ... extra_18_date']
```

The 19 columns that still pay the full cost are exactly the 19
genuinely-real-date columns in this schema (one per extra-column
cycle) — the fix correctly identifies them as needing the real
conversion, since skipping them would silently leave real dates as
unconverted strings, breaking correctness for the sake of speed. That
would be a worse bug than the one this fix solves. End-to-end on this
combination: **67.36s → 57.05s**, a real but much smaller 15%
reduction — verified correct at 10,000 mismatched rows, same as every
prior run on this combination.

**What this means, stated plainly:** this fix helps a lot on tables
where most string columns genuinely aren't dates (the common case for
ID/name/category/status-style columns) and helps much less on tables
with many genuine date columns, because converting real dates is
necessary, correct work this fix was never meant to eliminate. The
remaining cost on date-heavy wide tables is a real candidate for item
3 (the polars experiment) — not a sign this fix did the wrong thing.

## Still to measure

- S3-backed sources (network latency as a new variable)
- Database sources (`db://`), including `compare-dir`'s batch mode
- Realistic/messy data: real nulls, near-duplicate keys,
  `--fuzzy-keys` — still excluded from this clean baseline (real dates
  are now covered, via the `*_date` column in the width matrix)
- Whether the CSV/Parquet ordering flip between sandbox and Mac (at 5
  columns specifically) is a hardware effect, a pandas/pyarrow version
  difference, or something else — not yet investigated
- Why CSV's column-width compare-time penalty is smaller than its
  write-time penalty for the same column-count change — not yet
  investigated
- The actual polars experiment described above (#3) — not yet run
- XLSX at 1M rows × 100 columns — deliberately skipped (projected
  ~30 minutes combined); revisit only if a real use case needs it
