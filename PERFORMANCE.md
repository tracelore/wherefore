# Performance & scale notes

A living document, updated as new pressure-test results come in (S3,
databases, larger row counts, messier data). "Does this scale" only
has a real answer when backed by measurements — not a guarantee for
every machine or dataset shape.

## Methodology

- **Schema**: simple and clean for this first pass — `id` (int, join
  key), `name` (string), `amount` (float), `category` and `status`
  (low-cardinality strings). No dates, no nulls, no fuzzy keys yet —
  those come once the clean baseline is established.
- **Mismatch rate**: exactly 1% of rows have `amount` perturbed by a
  fixed delta, at every row count. Every comparison has real diff work
  to do, not a trivial all-match case.
- **Timing**: wall-clock via `subprocess` + `time.time()` around the
  real `wherefore compare` CLI — includes process startup, the real
  cost a user pays.
- **Memory**: peak RSS via `psutil`, sampling the process tree every
  50ms, not a single end-of-run snapshot.
- **Single run per number**, not averaged. Treat these as indicative
  of scale and shape — rerun before relying on an exact figure.

## Test environment (sandbox, round 1)

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Xeon @ 2.80GHz, **1 core** |
| Memory | 3.9 GiB total |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, x86_64 |
| Python | 3.12.3 |
| pandas | 3.0.2 |
| numpy | 2.4.4 |
| pyarrow | 24.0.0 |
| openpyxl | 3.1.5 |

A resource-constrained container, not representative hardware — well
below a typical workstation. **Treat the absolute times below as
round-1, sandbox-only.** What should transfer to real hardware is the
*shape* of the curves, not the exact seconds. Round 2 (a real Mac)
will confirm or correct this.

## Results: `wherefore compare`, single CSV/Parquet file pair

| Rows | CSV time (s) | CSV peak mem (MB) | Parquet time (s) | Parquet peak mem (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1.24 | 158.0 | 1.22 | 169.8 |
| 100,000 | 1.76 | 197.8 | 1.34 | 208.5 |
| 500,000 | 4.10 | 350.3 | 2.13 | 358.9 |
| 1,000,000 | 8.34 | 563.9 | 3.09 | 450.1 |

Both formats completed cleanly at every tier — no crash, no OOM, no
hang. Results verified correct (right key, right counts, right
mismatches) at every size, not just the smallest.

**Parquet is consistently faster, and the gap widens with scale** —
1.02× at 10K rows, 2.7× at 1M rows. Consistent with parquet's native
typing (no datetime-detection heuristic needed at all) and columnar
compression handling these low-cardinality columns well.

**Per-10K-row cost drops from 10K through 500K**, then flattens toward
linear between 500K and 1M. Most of that early improvement is fixed
per-run overhead (startup, imports) being amortized over more rows —
not the algorithm getting cheaper. Treat 500K–1M as the more
representative long-run rate.

## XLSX: write-time-dominated, scales far worse than CSV/Parquet

| Rows | XLSX write time (s, source only) | `wherefore compare` time (s) |
|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1.86 | 3.25 |
| 100,000 | 18.66 | 18.67 |
| 500,000 | *(not yet run)* | *(not yet run)* |
| 1,000,000 | *(not yet run)* | *(not yet run)* |

At 100K rows, total `wherefore compare` time (18.67s) is almost
identical to just the raw `openpyxl` write time (18.66s). The
bottleneck is openpyxl itself, not `wherefore`'s logic — openpyxl's
own docs describe it as CPU-intensive by design, with ~50× the file
size in memory when reading. Those are structural properties of the
library, not something `wherefore` can route around while still using
it.

500K/1M tiers are deferred for now. The 10K→100K trend (~10× time for
10× rows, from an already-slow baseline) projects to a minute or more
just to write the 500K file.

**Takeaway: XLSX is fine at the scale Excel itself is comfortable
with — low tens of thousands of rows. It's a poor choice for large
migration-audit comparisons.** Prefer CSV or Parquet, ideally Parquet,
for anything bigger. This is a property of the XLSX format and its
leading Python library, not a `wherefore` limitation.

## Where the time actually goes (1,000,000-row CSV breakdown)

Profiling `wherefore compare`'s real components in isolation, 1M-row
CSV pair, sandbox above:

| Step | Time (s) | Share of total |
|---|---|---|
| Raw `pd.read_csv` (both files) | ~2.30 | ~28% |
| Datetime-detection heuristic (both files) | ~2.25 | ~27% |
| `diff_engine.compare` (the actual comparison) | ~0.76 | ~9% |
| Startup, imports, report generation, remainder | ~3.0 | ~36% |

**The datetime-detection heuristic costs almost as much as the parse
it sits on top of** — roughly doubling load time. It runs on every
string column, every load, including columns with no relationship to
dates (a `name` column full of `"name_523891"`-style strings). The
cost is in the vectorized `pd.to_datetime` calls themselves (0.71s for
the `name` column alone) — not the pure-Python `isdigit()` pre-check,
which short-circuits in microseconds.

**The actual statistical comparison — the core value this tool
provides — is the cheapest major component measured.** There's real
headroom here: a cheap pre-check (sample a few values per column
before calling `pd.to_datetime` on the whole thing) could likely
recover a meaningful chunk of load time on wide, mostly-non-date
tables, without changing correctness. Not yet implemented — noted here
as a finding to revisit deliberately, not fixed reactively.

## Round 2: real hardware (Mac)

Same generator, same schema, same 1% mismatch rate, same measurement
method as round 1 — only the machine changed. This round also closes
the XLSX 500K/1M gap round 1 deferred.

### Test environment (Mac, round 2)

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Pro, Apple **M5 Max** |
| CPU | 18 cores (6 Super + 12 Performance) |
| Memory | 64 GiB total |
| Python | 3.14.6 |
| pandas | 2.3.3 |
| numpy | 2.4.6 |
| pyarrow | 24.0.0 |
| openpyxl | 3.1.5 |

### Results, all three formats, all four tiers

| Rows | CSV (s) | CSV mem (MB) | Parquet (s) | Parquet mem (MB) | XLSX write (s) | XLSX compare (s) | XLSX mem (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 0.48 | 161.5 | 1.59 | 171.3 | 0.50 | 0.80 | 164.9 |
| 100,000 | 0.60 | 216.5 | 0.53 | 270.2 | 4.64 | 3.64 | 251.1 |
| 500,000 | 1.33 | 479.3 | 0.93 | 646.0 | 23.68 | 17.13 | 650.3 |
| 1,000,000 | 2.26 | 873.9 | 1.46 | 984.8 | 48.61 | 34.70 | 1,168.0 |

All three formats completed cleanly at every tier, including the
500K/1M XLSX tiers round 1 had to skip. Results verified correct at
1,000,000 rows for every format — exactly 10,000 mismatched rows
(1% of 1M), same as round 1.

**The relative ordering of CSV vs. Parquet flipped from round 1.** On
this Mac, CSV is consistently as fast as or faster than Parquet at
every tier — the opposite of the sandbox, where Parquet pulled ahead
and the gap widened with scale. The 10K-row Parquet number (1.59s) is
likely first-call pyarrow overhead, not a real per-row cost — it drops
to 0.53s at 100K rows, faster than the 10K number despite 10× the
data. Take this as a reminder that small-N numbers are noisy; the
500K–1M rows are the more trustworthy comparison, and even there CSV
and Parquet are close enough (1.33s vs 0.93s at 500K; 2.26s vs 1.46s at
1M) that format choice between the two is not the lever that matters
on this hardware. It clearly was in the sandbox.

**XLSX confirms the round-1 projection, at much better absolute
numbers.** Round 1 estimated "a minute or more" to write 500K rows;
real numbers came in at 23.68s — better than feared, but still by far
the dominant cost in the pipeline at every tier. At 1,000,000 rows,
writing the file (48.61s) takes longer than generating two 1M-row CSVs
*and* running the full comparison on both, combined, several times
over. More cores and a faster single-core clock clearly help openpyxl
somewhat (round 1's 1-core sandbox took 18.66s to write 100K rows;
this Mac took 4.64s — roughly 4×), but the structural cost openpyxl
itself describes (CPU-intensive by design) doesn't disappear just
because the hardware is faster. **The takeaway from round 1 stands,
now confirmed at full scale on real hardware: prefer CSV or Parquet
over XLSX for any comparison past tens of thousands of rows.**

**Memory stayed trivial against 64GB at every tier** — even XLSX's
worst case (1,168MB at 1M rows) used under 2% of available RAM. The
sandbox's tighter 4GB ceiling was never actually close to binding for
CSV/Parquet either, in retrospect; XLSX at 1M rows in that sandbox
would have been the one real risk, which round 1 avoided testing by
deferring it — a reasonable call at the time, confirmed unnecessary in
hindsight only because we now have the real number.

## Round 2: proof, not just numbers

The table above is real, but a table alone asks you to trust it. Here
is one full, real report — exact command, exact output, nothing
trimmed except the middle of the example-row list:

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Projects/Personal/wherefore-scale-test
$ wherefore compare data/source_1000000.csv data/target_1000000.csv \
    --output results/report_1000000_csv.md
Compared 1000000 source rows against 1000000 target rows.
Matched rows: 1000000
  amount: 10000 mismatches, pattern unrecognized

Full report written to results/report_1000000_csv.md
```

```
$ cat results/report_1000000_csv.md
# wherefore comparison report

- Source: `data/source_1000000.csv`
- Target: `data/target_1000000.csv`
- Join key: `id`
- Source rows: 1000000
- Target rows: 1000000
- Matched rows: 1000000

## Mismatches by column (1 column(s) affected)

### `amount` -- 10000 mismatched row(s)

No known failure pattern's statistical signature matched this cluster.

Example rows:

- `{'id': 333}`: `8608.58` -> `9108.58`
- `{'id': 667}`: `9987.45` -> `10487.45`
- `{'id': 692}`: `2358.62` -> `2858.62`
- `{'id': 978}`: `5323.54` -> `5823.54`
- `{'id': 1029}`: `4037.37` -> `4537.37`
- ... and 9995 more
```

The `+500.0` delta we inject is visible in every example row
(`8608.58 -> 9108.58` is exactly `+500.0`, etc.) — this is the actual
mechanism by which "verified correct" is checked throughout this
document, not an assertion taken on faith. The reports do not currently
say *why* `amount` differs (no taxonomy signature matched, since a flat
`+500.0` shift isn't one of the eight known patterns) — this is
expected and correct behavior, not a bug: it's the same "report the
shape, not a fabricated cause" principle [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md)
describes for the clustering layer generally. A real timezone-shift or
truncation corruption, run through the same pipeline, would name the
matched pattern here instead of "pattern unrecognized."

## Round 3: column count, not just row count

Every test above used a fixed 5-column schema. That leaves a real
question unanswered: does *width* (column count), independent of row
count, change the numbers? Real estate tables, customer records, and
most migration-audit tables in practice have dozens of columns, not
five.

### Schema

Base 5 columns are unchanged from rounds 1–2 (`id`, `name`, `amount`,
`category`, `status`). Additional columns are added in a repeating
cycle of 5 realistic types, so every width tier is a strict superset
of the smaller ones:

| Extra column type | What it is | Why it's included |
|---|---|---|
| `*_date` | Real `YYYY-MM-DD` string, always parseable | The original schema never had a column that *successfully* parsed as a date — this exercises that path for the first time |
| `*_text` | ~80-char free text | Tests whether string length, not just column count, matters |
| `*_int` | Plain integer | Cheap baseline |
| `*_float` | Plain float | Cheap baseline |
| `*_flag` | Low-cardinality string (`yes`/`no`) | Same shape as `status` |

Column tiers tested: 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100. Same 1% `amount` mismatch
rate as every other round, so results stay comparable.

### Results: 10,000 rows, varying column count

**20× more columns (5→100), at a fixed 10,000 rows:** CSV time grows
2.3×, Parquet 1.6×, XLSX 8.0×. Column count is a real, independent
cost — confirming the question this section exists to answer.

Verified correct at the widest, slowest tier:

```
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n100000_c100_csv.md
### `amount` -- 1000 mismatched row(s)
$ grep "mismatched row" width_test/results/report_n100000_c100_xlsx.md
### `amount` -- 1000 mismatched row(s)
```

**The column-count penalty gets worse as rows increase — it does not
stay fixed.** At 10K rows, 20× more columns cost CSV 2.3× more time.
At 100K rows, the same 20× column increase costs CSV **9.0×** more
time. Rows and columns compound, they don't just add. The same
pattern holds for Parquet (1.6× → 4.5×) and XLSX (8.0× → 16.5×).

**Memory scales consistently across formats once data is loaded** —
roughly 8× for 20× more columns, at both row tiers, for all three
formats. This makes sense: once a file is read into a DataFrame, the
in-memory cost depends on the data itself, not which format it came
from.

**Practical reading:** a real-world 100-column table is not "the same
as a 5-column table, just a bit slower." At 100K rows it's a genuinely
different cost regime — XLSX in particular goes from a 3.8s
nuisance at 5 columns to a full minute at 100. CSV and Parquet stay
fast in absolute terms at every width tested so far, but the *trend*
(worsening per-column cost as rows grow) is the more important finding
than any single number — it says the 500K/1M/wide-table corner of this
matrix, not yet tested, is where real risk is most likely to live.

*250K, 500K, and 1M-row tiers at full column width are in progress —
this section will be updated as those results come in.*

## Still to measure

- Column-width matrix at 250K, 500K, and 1M rows (in progress)
- S3-backed sources (network latency as a new variable)
- Database sources (`db://`), including `compare-dir`'s batch mode
- Realistic/messy data: real dates, nulls, near-duplicate keys,
  `--fuzzy-keys` — all excluded from this clean baseline
- Whether the CSV/Parquet ordering flip between sandbox and Mac is a
  hardware effect, a pandas/pyarrow version difference (3.0.2 vs
  2.3.3, 24.0.0 both), or something else — not yet investigated, noted
  as a real open question rather than guessed at
- Why CSV's column-width compare-time penalty (2.3×→9.0×) is so much
  smaller than its write-time penalty (40× at 10K rows) for the same
  5→100 column change — not yet investigated
