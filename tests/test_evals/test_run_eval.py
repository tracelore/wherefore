Tests for evals/harness/run_eval.py. Includes a real integration test
against the actual committed fixtures in evals/fixtures/ -- this is
deliberately NOT mocked, since the entire point of the eval harness is
proving the real pipeline (load -> diff -> cluster) produces correct
results against real, committed, labeled data. If this test breaks,
it usually means something upstream genuinely regressed -- which is
exactly the kind of regression an eval harness exists to catch.
