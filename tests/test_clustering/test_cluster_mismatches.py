"""
Tests for clustering/cluster_mismatches.py. Includes a regression test
for a real bug caught while building this: patterns_by_dtype originally
did exact string matching ('datetime64[s]' != 'datetime'), which meant
NO cluster ever matched any pattern on real pandas data, despite the
signature itself scoring correctly in isolation. Fixed in
taxonomy/registry.py via dtype-family matching -- see that module's
_dtype_matches_family for the real dtype strings this was tested against.
