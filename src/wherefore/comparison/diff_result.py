comparison/diff_result.py

Defines `DiffResult`, the canonical, normalized representation of "what
differs between source and target" that diff_engine.py produces and
clustering/cluster_mismatches.py consumes. This is the contract
boundary between the comparison engine and everything downstream --
clustering and the LLM never touch datacompy's raw output directly,
only this shape. That's what makes the underlying diff library
swappable later without touching clustering or reasoning.

Design note: this schema was designed AGAINST REAL datacompy 1.0.2
output, not speculated in advance (see the original stub's note about
an "open question" on dtype-mismatch vs. value-mismatch representation
-- resolved below, see DiffResult.column_summary).

What real datacompy.PandasCompare exposes that this wraps:
  - `compare.intersect_rows`: every joined row, source AND target value
    per column side by side, plus a `{column}_match` boolean per
    non-key column. This is the richest source available and is what
    `mismatches` (list[MismatchRow]) is built from -- it gives precise
    per-row, per-column mismatch detail, which neither `all_mismatch()`
    (row-level only) nor `column_stats` (column-level only) provide
    alone.
  - `compare.column_stats`: per-column dtype1/dtype2/unequal_cnt --
    this is where dtype mismatches are visible distinctly from
    value-level mismatches (a column can have dtype1 != dtype2 while
    individual values still "match" after coercion, or vice versa) --
    preserved as `ColumnSummary` below.
  - `compare.df1_unq_rows` / `compare.df2_unq_rows`: rows present in
    only one side -- preserved as `source_only_keys` / `target_only_keys`.
