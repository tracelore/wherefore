comparison/diff_engine.py

Thin wrapper around datacompy.PandasCompare that converts its output
into DiffResult. Deliberately stays thin -- if logic here grows beyond
"call datacompy, reshape the output," that logic belongs in
key_matching.py or clustering instead. See diff_result.py's module
docstring for exactly which datacompy attributes this reads and why.

Explicitly NOT this file's job: any pattern detection, clustering, or
causal reasoning. This is the line where "detecting THAT things
differ" ends and "explaining WHY" begins.

    useful for float_precision-adjacent cases where the caller already
    knows to tolerate tiny float rounding, though by default we use
    exact (0, 0) tolerance so float_precision drift is VISIBLE to
    clustering rather than silently absorbed here. Loosening tolerance
    is a caller decision, not a default -- silently swallowing small
    diffs would hide exactly the kind of pattern this tool exists to
