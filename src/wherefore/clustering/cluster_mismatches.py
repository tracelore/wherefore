clustering/cluster_mismatches.py

The deterministic layer between the raw DiffResult and the LLM. Two jobs:

  1. GROUP mismatches into clusters worth explaining together. v1
     heuristic: group by column. This is cheap, explainable grouping,
     not ML clustering -- only reach for something fancier (e.g.
     sub-grouping within a column by shape of the diff) if simple
     per-column grouping demonstrably fails on real fixtures.

  2. DETECT: for each cluster, find candidate taxonomy patterns whose
     `detection_hints[0].applies_to_dtypes` matches the cluster's
     column dtype (via taxonomy.registry.patterns_by_dtype), run each
     candidate's signature function (clustering/signatures.py), and
     keep matches at or above `confidence_threshold`. If a pattern
     declares a `confirmation_function`, it's called as a second gate
     before accepting the match (the compound-signature escape hatch
     from taxonomy/schema.py -- not yet exercised by any real pattern,
     since dedup_failure isn't built yet, but the wiring is here).

`confidence_threshold` defaults to 0.9 and is a plain parameter, not a
hardcoded constant -- callers needing stricter matching (e.g. the eval
harness scoring fixtures generated from a controlled synthetic domain,
where a clean signal is expected) can pass 1.0; this is deliberately
NOT domain-aware inside clustering itself. Domain is a synthetic-data
generation concept (see synthetic/base_dataset.py); clustering and
DiffResult have no notion of which domain produced the data they're
given, and should stay that way -- that's what keeps clustering
genuinely reusable on arbitrary real-world CSVs, not just our own
fixtures. Callers who want stricter behavior for a specific context
choose their own threshold; clustering doesn't guess for them.

Output per cluster: candidate_patterns (possibly empty -- "no match
above threshold" is communicated by an empty list, not a special
sentinel) handed to the LLM as either "this looks like X, write the
causal narrative" or, when empty, explicitly unrecognized so the LLM
can say so honestly. candidate_patterns can also legitimately contain
MORE THAN ONE pattern -- see "On multiple legitimate matches" below.

On multiple legitimate matches: clustering deliberately does NOT
suppress or prioritize one candidate over another when more than one
signature fires above threshold for the same cluster, even when one
signature is intuitively "more specific" than another. Real example
discovered while building null_type_coercion: a column where a
genuine null was coerced to the literal string "NULL" produces a
cluster where BOTH null_sentinel_coercion (source=NaT, target="NULL")
AND consistent_value_mapping (the same source value consistently maps
to the same target value -- which is also, technically, true here)
fire at confidence 1.0. It's tempting to add a priority rule
("null_type_coercion should win because its signature is more
specific") -- but doing so would mean clustering is making a CAUSAL
judgment call about which explanation is more plausible, which is
exactly the kind of inference this layer is designed not to make (see
"Design reminder" below). Instead, both candidates are reported
honestly, and disambiguation is left to the reasoning layer, which has
something clustering never will: the actual cited values and the
ability to reason in words about which explanation actually fits (e.g.
"the source being genuinely null, not just present-but-different,
indicates a type-coercion artifact rather than a deliberate category
rename"). See test_cluster_mismatches.py for a test locking in this
behavior as intentional.

Design reminder: this layer must NOT do the LLM's job for it. It
supplies statistical observations only -- "9 of 9 rows in this cluster
differ by exactly 5 hours" -- never a causal claim like "this is a
timezone bug." See CONTRIBUTING.md: "Why clustering must never make
causal claims."
