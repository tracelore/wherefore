clustering/signatures.py

The actual detector functions that taxonomy YAML files reference by
string key (e.g. "constant_offset_subset" in timezone_shift.yaml).
Kept separate from cluster_mismatches.py so that:
  - adding a new signature is additive (register a function here,
    reference it by name in a new pattern's YAML)
  - signature functions are independently unit-testable against real
    MismatchRow data without needing the full clustering pipeline

Every signature function takes `list[MismatchRow]` (already filtered
to one column by the caller -- see cluster_mismatches.py) and returns
a confidence float in [0, 1]. PURELY STATISTICAL -- no causal language,
no pattern naming beyond what's mechanically measured. See
CONTRIBUTING.md: "Why clustering must never make causal claims."

    Computes target - source for every mismatch, finds the most
    common delta, and returns the fraction of mismatches sharing that
    exact delta. Deliberately tolerant of a minority of differently-
    shifted or unrelated outliers within the same cluster (e.g. a
    cluster might catch both a timezone bug AND a handful of unrelated
    data-entry errors in the same column) -- requiring a literal 100%

    Confidence that mismatched values in this cluster are explained by

    Deliberately does NOT require every mismatch to be cut to the
    SAME length -- different rows can be truncated to different
    lengths in practice (e.g. a fixed byte-length limit on a
    multi-byte-encoded string truncates different strings to different

def consistent_value_mapping(mismatches: list[MismatchRow]) -> float:

    Confidence that mismatches in this cluster are explained by a
    systematic value recode: for each distinct source value seen in
    the cluster, does it ALWAYS map to the same target value? This is
    the signature of enum_drift.yaml's detection_hints -- a real
    migration recode ('approved' -> 'APPROVED') is a consistent
    function from source value to target value, not noise.

    Computed per distinct source value, then averaged (weighted by
    how many mismatches each source value contributes) -- so a cluster
    where 'approved' consistently maps to 'APPROVED' but 'denied'
    inconsistently maps to different things on different rows scores
    partial confidence proportional to how much of the cluster is
    explained by a clean mapping, not an all-or-nothing pass/fail
    across the whole cluster.

    REQUIRES REPETITION TO COUNT AS EVIDENCE: a source value that
    appears only ONCE in the cluster contributes nothing to the
    confidence score, regardless of what it mapped to. Confirmed by
    direct testing that without this guard, a column of unique
    free-text values (e.g. truncated names, where every person's name
    is different) trivially scores 1.0 here too -- every "source value"
    appears once, so it's vacuously "consistent" with itself, which is
    a real false-positive risk once enum_drift and truncation compete
    for the same string-dtype clusters. A genuine recode is only
    visible as a pattern across REPEATED source values; a column where
    nothing repeats can't demonstrate that pattern at all and should
    score 0 contribution from those rows, not 1.

    one side is genuinely null (via pd.isna()) and the OTHER side is a
