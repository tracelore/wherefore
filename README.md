**Explains *why* two datasets differ — not just that they do.**

Data diffing tools (data-diff, Great Expectations, OpenMetadata data diff,
datacompy) tell you *that* 40 rows mismatched in column `created_at`.
None of them tell you *why* — that those 40 mismatches share one root
cause: a timezone conversion applied inconsistently during a migration
window. `wherefore` is the layer that sits on top of a diff and answers
that question, in plain English, with real example rows cited, and
honestly says "I don't recognize this pattern" when nothing fits known
failure modes — rather than confidently guessing wrong.

This is not a thin prompt wrapper. The AI reasoning layer sits behind a
deterministic clustering and statistical-signature step, and every
accuracy claim this project makes is backed by an eval harness scored
against labeled synthetic ground truth — see [Evals](#evals--why-trust-the-explanations) below.

## Status

🚧 **Actively built in public. The CLI works end-to-end through statistical pattern detection — the AI narrative layer is the next piece.**

What's real today:
- **A working CLI**: `wherefore compare a.csv b.csv` runs against real
  files on disk and produces a report — see [Try it yourself](#try-it-yourself-with-your-own-files)
  below
- Comparison engine wrapping `datacompy`: schema-aware diffing,
  composite join keys, dtype-mismatch detection distinct from
  value-mismatch detection
- Fuzzy key matching for when source/target keys don't align exactly
  (e.g. a key column reformatted during migration), with deliberate
  safeguards against false-confidence matches and ambiguous ties
- Deterministic clustering: groups mismatches by column, runs
  statistical signature checks against candidate taxonomy patterns,
  outputs confidence-scored matches with **zero causal language** —
  enforced by a structural test, not just convention
- The taxonomy system: failure patterns are defined as data (YAML), not
  code, validated against a strict schema — see [Architecture](#architecture)
- Five fully implemented, end-to-end-tested failure patterns:
  `timezone_shift`, `truncation`, `enum_drift`, `null_type_coercion`,
  and `float_precision` — corruptor → detection signature → registry →
  real diff → real cluster match → real CLI report, each proven
  against real files. Building the fourth pattern surfaced three real
  bugs spanning the comparison engine, the loaders, and the eval
  harness itself, and the fifth surfaced a subtler lesson — a
  magnitude-based heuristic that looked right scored a real false
  positive on an adversarial test case, fixed by checking the
  underlying mechanism (an exact float32 round-trip) directly instead
  of approximating its size — see
  [`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md) for the full account of
  both.
- The AI reasoning layer is built and **verified against the real
  Claude API**: a `ClusterExplanation` schema, a swappable `Provider`
  interface, and a real Claude integration that uses *forced* tool-use
  so the model can't return free-text prose — it must call a tool
  whose schema is generated directly from the pydantic model, so the
  two can't silently drift apart. Tested against real fixtures from
  three patterns plus a genuinely unrecognized case — across all
  four, the model gave sound causal reasoning, correctly ruled out
  competing explanations using the actual data, and correctly refused
  to force-fit a pattern when none applied. See
  [`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md) for the full results.
- **Wired into the CLI** behind an explicit `--explain` flag — off by
  default, so the tool stays free and key-free for anyone just trying
  it out. With `--explain` (and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set), the report
  shows the AI's narrative *alongside* the statistical evidence it was
  reasoned from, not instead of it — so you can verify the claim
  against the raw data yourself.

What's not built yet: the eval harness scoring loop that runs this at
scale against many labeled fixtures and computes precision/recall per
corruption type. See [`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md) for the
live build queue.

## The problem, in plain terms

Imagine two boxes of identical LEGO sets. Someone copied box A into box
B, but a few pieces are missing or the wrong color. Most tools that
check this say: *"12 pieces are different."* That's it.

`wherefore` looks at those 12 differences and says: *"These aren't
random — every one of them has the same color swapped the same way,
consistent with a colorblind sort. That's your root cause."* It explains
the pattern behind the differences, not just the differences themselves.

To know if the tool is actually doing this well (not just sounding
plausible), we build our own "messed-up" datasets on purpose — corrupt
them in a specific, *labeled* way — and grade whether the tool correctly
identifies what we did. That's the eval harness, and it's first-class
in this project, not an afterthought.

**Failure patterns are data, not code.** Each known failure mode
(timezone shift, truncation, encoding mismatch, null/type coercion,
dedup failure, key mismatch, float precision loss, enum drift) is a YAML
file under `src/wherefore/taxonomy/patterns/`, validated against a strict
schema. Adding a new pattern means writing a YAML file and a small
corruptor function — never touching clustering or reasoning code. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contract and the
design tradeoffs behind it.

**Clustering and reasoning are deliberately separated.** The clustering
layer only ever produces statistical observations ("these 12 rows differ
by exactly 5 hours"). Causal attribution ("this is a timezone bug") is
the LLM's job, every time — if clustering started asserting causes, the
AI layer would become decorative and the eval harness would stop
measuring anything meaningful.

## Evals — why trust the explanations?

Because we control the ground truth. The synthetic data generator
creates clean datasets, then deliberately corrupts them using one of
the taxonomy's known failure patterns — and records exactly what it
did and to which rows in a committed `ground_truth.json`. The eval
harness runs the real pipeline against these labeled fixtures and
scores the result, tracked as precision/recall per pattern, with
"correctly said unrecognized" tracked separately from "confidently
named the wrong pattern" — those are very different failure modes a
naive right/wrong scorer would conflate.

**Current results, statistical mode (clustering's signature match,
free, no API key), against all 6 committed fixtures:**

```
$ python3 -m evals.harness.run_eval
=== Statistical eval (clustering only, free, no API key) ===
Total cases: 6
Overall accuracy (correct match + honest abstain): 100.00%
Outcome breakdown: {'true_positive': 5, 'honest_abstain': 1}

  enum_drift: precision=1.00 recall=1.00 (TP=1 FP=0 FN=0)
  float_precision: precision=1.00 recall=1.00 (TP=1 FP=0 FN=0)
  null_type_coercion: precision=1.00 recall=1.00 (TP=1 FP=0 FN=0)
  timezone_shift: precision=1.00 recall=1.00 (TP=1 FP=0 FN=0)
  truncation: precision=1.00 recall=1.00 (TP=1 FP=0 FN=0)
```

This is reproducible by anyone who clones the repo — run the command
above yourself. Fixtures and their ground-truth labels are committed
(`evals/fixtures/`), generated by `evals/fixtures/regenerate.py` using
the real corruptor functions, not hand-written or invented.

One real subtlety worth knowing: `null_type_coercion` and `enum_drift`
can legitimately BOTH match the same cluster (a null consistently
coerced to one sentinel string is, statistically, also a "consistent
value mapping"). Clustering reports both honestly rather than guessing
which is "more right" — that's a causal judgment, and causal judgment
is the AI layer's job, not clustering's. The eval harness scores this
correctly too: a true pattern counts as found if it appears anywhere
among the reported candidates, not only if it happens to be listed
first. See [`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md) for the full story
of how this was discovered and fixed.

**LLM mode** (`--llm` flag, real Claude API calls, scores `explain()`'s
narrative attribution instead of clustering's raw statistics) exists
and is gated the same way `--explain` is in the CLI — requires
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, off by default. Run it yourself:
`python3 -m evals.harness.run_eval --llm`.

Six fixtures is a small sample — enough to prove the harness itself
works correctly, not enough to claim robust statistical confidence.
Expanding fixture coverage (more examples per pattern, edge cases,
multi-corruption fixtures) is tracked in
[`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md).

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArunMishra1/wherefore.git
cd wherefore
./dev_setup.sh
```

This creates a `.venv/`, installs the package in editable mode with dev
dependencies, and runs the test suite (should show **189 passed**). It's
safe to re-run — it skips recreating an existing `.venv`.

**No API key needed for this.** The test suite covers the AI reasoning
layer entirely with a fake provider — no network calls, no cost. An
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is only needed if you want to actually run
`explain()` against the real Claude API:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

After the first run, activate the environment in new shells with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if you'd rather not run the script)</summary>

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```
</details>

**Requires Python 3.10+.** Tested on 3.10–3.12. If you're on a very
recent Python (e.g. 3.14), pandas/numpy themselves are compatible, but
if `pip install` fails, a smaller transitive dependency without 3.14
wheels yet is the likely cause — try a 3.11/3.12 interpreter if you hit
this.

### Try it yourself, with your own files

```bash
wherefore compare old_export.csv new_export.csv --output report.md
```

That's the whole interface. Two files in, a Markdown report out. No
key column required — `wherefore` looks at your columns and picks the
one that looks like an identifier (mostly-unique values, often named
something with "id" or "key" in it). If it picks wrong, or your files
don't share an obvious key, tell it directly:

```bash
wherefore compare old_export.csv new_export.csv --key employee_id
```

If the same record has a different-looking key on each side — a
common symptom of a migration where IDs got reformatted, e.g.
`EMP-1001` became `EMP1001` — add `--fuzzy-keys`:

```bash
wherefore compare old_export.csv new_export.csv --fuzzy-keys
```

Here's a concrete run. Two small HR exports, identical except every
`hire_date` is five hours later in the new file — the kind of thing
that happens when an export job's server timezone changes during a
migration and nobody notices until payroll runs wrong:

```bash
$ wherefore compare old_export.csv new_export.csv --output report.md
Compared 5 source rows against 5 target rows.
Matched rows: 5
  hire_date: 5 mismatches, matches 'timezone_shift' (confidence 1.00)

Full report written to report.md
```

That confidence score is a real, deterministic measurement — every
mismatched value differs from its source by exactly the same 5-hour
delta, which is the statistical signature `wherefore` checks for. By
default that's *all* you get — real diffing, real grouping, real
pattern matching, with no AI involved and no API key needed.

To get an actual plain-English explanation of *why* this happened —
not just confirmation that the pattern matched — add `--explain`
(requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; this makes a real, billed API call per
cluster):

```bash
$ wherefore compare old_export.csv new_export.csv --explain
Calling Claude for 1 cluster(s)...
Compared 5 source rows against 5 target rows.
Matched rows: 5
  hire_date: 5 mismatches, matches 'timezone_shift' (confidence 1.00)
    AI: Every affected row is shifted forward by exactly 5 hours,
    consistent with a UTC-vs-local-time mismatch introduced during
    the export. Likely cause: the source system's timestamps were
    re-interpreted in the wrong timezone during migration.

Full report written to report.md
```

The report includes the AI's narrative *alongside* the statistical
evidence it was reasoned from — not instead of it — so you can check
the claim against the actual data yourself rather than trusting it
blindly.

If nothing in the taxonomy matches what's actually wrong in your data,
`wherefore` says so — `pattern unrecognized` — rather than forcing a
guess, and (with `--explain`) the AI does the same: in testing, it
correctly identified a genuinely random, non-matching corruption and
proposed real alternative hypotheses (a bad join, a mis-wired column)
instead of inventing a pattern that wasn't there. Right now the
taxonomy has five patterns (`timezone_shift`, `truncation`,
`enum_drift`, `null_type_coercion`, `float_precision`); more are being
added, tracked in [`TAXONOMY_TODO.md`](./TAXONOMY_TODO.md).
