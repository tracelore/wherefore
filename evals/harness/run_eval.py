"""
evals/harness/run_eval.py

Orchestrates a full eval run against every fixture in
evals/fixtures/: loads each fixture's ground truth, runs the REAL
pipeline (load CSV -> diff -> cluster, and optionally -> explain), and
scores the result against ground truth via scoring.py.

Two modes:
  - Statistical (always runs, free, no API key needed): scores
    whether cluster_mismatches()'s candidate_patterns correctly
    identifies the injected pattern via its statistical signature
    alone.
  - LLM (opt-in via --llm flag, costs real money, requires
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY): additionally scores whether explain()'s
    matched_pattern_id agrees with ground truth. Off by default for
    the same reason --explain is off by default in the CLI.

Note on what's actually being scored for each fixture: ground truth
records which COLUMN was corrupted (affected_column) and what pattern
was injected there. Scoring looks specifically at the cluster for
affected_column -- not just "did ANY cluster in this fixture match,"
which would be a weaker and less precise claim.
